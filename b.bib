   abstract = {A thermal gravimetric method was used to measure rates of decomposition of NAHCO, particles. Such decomposition produces a highly porous Na,Co, that reacts with SO, rapidly and completely at moderate temperatures. Hence, NaHCO, decomposition provides a reactant with attractive features for SO, removal. The rapid rate of decomposition combined with the high heat effect prevented determining intrinsic rates by constant temperature runs when the temperature level was above 400 K. However, rising-temperature runs, which allowed time for heat transfer to equilibrate temperatures of the thermocouple and particles, gave reliable results at high temperatures. The activation energy was 102 kJ/mol. Porosimeter data verified the large increase in pore volume (from 0.03 to 0.39 x lo-, m3/kg) on converting the NaHCO, particles to Na,CO,. First-order kinetics were observed up to high conversions, after which the apparent order decreased. However, the sodium bicar-bonate could be completely converted to Na,CO,. SCOPE It has been well established that thermal decomposition of NaHCO, particles can produce a highly porous Na,CO, product that reacts rapidly with SO, in waste gases (Bares et at., 1970; Marecek et al., 1970). Also, rates of decomposition and of reaction with SO, have been measured separately on different samples (Sub-ramanian et al., 1972; Guarini et al., 1973; Bares et al., 1970; Marecek et al., 1970). Our objective was to determine the rate of decomposition of a sample of NaHCO, particles at temperatures from 373 to 473 K over the complete range of conversion. A TGA apparatus was employed since this allowed very small sample masses to be used (leading to accurate rates) and the effect of heat and mass of transfer processes could usually be eliminated. Pore-volume data also were obtained on NaHCO, and Na,CO, particles. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE The rapid rate of decomposition of NaHCO, combined with a large, endothermic heat effect required careful choice of operating conditions to obtain rates unaffected by heat transfer. At temperatures above 400 K this required the TGA experiments to be conducted by the rising-temperature method. The results showed that intrinsic kinetics were first-order in mass of NaHCO, up to high conversions. The retardation of the rate beyond this point may be due to changes in the},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
